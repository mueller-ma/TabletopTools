# Tabletop tools

This Android app provides a few handy tools for tabletop games:
* Dices (D3, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100)
* [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
* Number converter: Decimal <=> Binary <=> Hexadecimal

More tools are planned.

## Translations

You can help translating this app by coping the file `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` to `app/src/main/res/values-xx/strings.xml` (`xx` stands for your language code), removing all entries marked with `translatable="false"` and translating the remaining entries. This file contains all strings used in the app.

The app store description can also be translated: Copy `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt` and `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/short_description.txt` to `fastlane/metadata/android/xx-YY/full_description.txt` (`xx` is the language code, `YY` is the country code) and translate the file.
